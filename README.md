ðŸš€ Successfully Deployed a Multi-VM Application Stack! ðŸš€
Recently, I set up a full-fledged multi-VM architecture by following a structured approach:
âœ… Configured multiple VMs
âœ… Installed and set up MySQL for database management
âœ… Integrated Memcached for caching
âœ… Deployed RabbitMQ for message queuing
âœ… Set up the application layer
âœ… Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy
âœ… Validated the entire setup to ensure smooth operations
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in multi-tier deployment, service orchestration, and validationâ€”key skills for any DevOps engineer.
âœ… ElasticSearch â€“ Search indexing service
The project involves setting up multiple virtual machines (VMs) using Vagrant, each hosting a different service, and then configuring them to work together seamlessly.
